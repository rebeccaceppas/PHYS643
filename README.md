# Numerical Solver for Viscously Accreting Disk

This code numerically solves for the time evolution of a viscously accreding disk. It starts from an initial condition of a sharply peaked gaussian at the centre of the grid and evolves through advection and diffusion to show changes in the disk over time. Commented out are the lines used to turn the plots into a gif that will be submitted separately. 

Packages used:
1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. scipy
4. imageio (not needed unless exporting gif)

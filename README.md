# Numerical Solver for Viscously Accreting Disk

This code numerically solves for the time evolution of a viscously accreding disk. It starts from an initial condition of a sharply peaked gaussian at the centre of the grid and evolves through advection and diffusion to show changes in the disk over time. 

Packages used:
1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. scipy
